# AIDL_SelfDrivingProject

 
 **Motivation-Problems and Challenges**

SelfDriving cars are important because they help to reduce road accidents. But they also create new risks.  

**Critical Tasks**

In order to mitigate these risks, the autonomous vehicle has to be able to sense and react to its surroundings by performing at least three critical tasks: object detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane detection

**The Visual Perception System**

a visual perception system is needed to perform these critical tasks

**Main Project Goal**

we will focus on the first critical task of the visual perception system, namely, traffic object detection
